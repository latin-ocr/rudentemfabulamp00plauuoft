THE PROLOGUE.

λ auruum.

Of the company of the celestials am Ι, a comrade of
Jove, who sways all peoples and seas and lands. 1 am, as
you see, a constellation, lustrous with a bright star, which
ever rises in its season. Arcturus is the name I bear on
earth, and in heaven. By night Ι shine conspicuous in the
sky among the gods; my path lies among mortals in the
day. Other constellations, too, descend from heaven to earth.
Jupiter the lord of gods and men—he it is who stations us
throughout the world, one here, one there, to take know-
ledge of the conduct, character, righteous'ness and sealty of
mortal men, that every one may meet with his deserts.
then men institute fraudulent actions on salse witness, and
when before the magistrate they deny on oath a deposit,
their names we enter and report to Jove. Day by day
he knows who is plotting mischief here below. When men
seek to win a suit by perjury——rascals that they are l—or when
by fraud they gain their cases before a judge, the judgment
given he judges once again: far heavier the fine he orders
than what they reap as litigants. The good he keeps entered
on another list„ And if the rogues take it into their heads
that they can propitiate Jupiter with offerings and sacrifice,
they lose their pains and their money too. The reason is
this: no sacrifice is acceptable to Jove from a perjuret.
