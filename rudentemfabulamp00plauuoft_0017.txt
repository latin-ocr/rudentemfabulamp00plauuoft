THE ARGUMENT.

Recovered from the ocean lies a wallet which contains,
Unknown to him who drew it out, intent upon his ‹gain-5,
Designs in cunning workrnanship, a little axe and sword,
Erstwhile the trinkets osa maid, the daughter of his lord;
*Nigh carried off in slavery, but shipwrecked here instead,

She, by the trinkets recognized, is to her lover wed.
