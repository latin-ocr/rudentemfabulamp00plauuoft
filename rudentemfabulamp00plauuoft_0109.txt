THE RUDENS OF PLAUTUS. 87

say. Is this the wallet which you said contained your casket Ρ
ΡΑ. It is.

GR. Alas, I'm quite done sor ! You declared in was yours
right away on the spot, before you had a fair look at it.

ΡΑ. I’ll make all this plain sailing for you. There should
be a wooden casket in the wallet. I’ll give you a list of its
contents, one after anotlier—-don't show me any of them. If
Ι go wrong, 1 shall have lost my breath in vain l But, all the
same, you will get back everything that's in the wallet. If l
am right, then Ι beg that you will hand back to me what is
mme.

ΒΑΕ. Agreed ! Your request is only right to my thinking.

GR. Gad, to my thinking. it's all wrong. What if she is a
witch or a wise woman and can tell everything that’s in the .
casket without a mistake! Are we to let the things go to
a witch ?

ΒΑΕ. No, she won’t get it unless she is correct. Her

witchcraft will be all in vain. Now, untie the wallet and let
us know at once how matters stand.

ΤΚ. That’s one for Gripus!

GR. Untied it is ; I’m done for! There⁷s the casket.

DAE. What, is this it?

ΡΑ. That’s it. Dear parents mine, for me ye are under-

neath that lid. There did I store away the means and hope
, of finding you.

GR. T hen. i' saith, the Gods must be wrath with you, who-
ever you are, for having crammed your father and mother
into so small a space.

ΒΑΕ. 'Come here, Gripus, this touches you. You, young
lady, stand where you are an'd tell us the contents, and say
what each is like. Don't omit anything. If you make the
least slip, egad, and then expect to put yourself right after-
wards, you will have utterly wasted your breath‚ my girl.
