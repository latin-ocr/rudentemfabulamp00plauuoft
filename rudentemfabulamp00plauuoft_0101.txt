TR. llow do you work it?
GR. Let me be gone; you go your own way and keep
it close. Don't you give mc away to anybody and Ι won⁷t

give anything away to you. You hold your tongue ; I’ll keep

mum—that’s fair and square.

TR. Won’t you make an offer?

GR. I've been doing so this long time. You be off! Drop
the rope, and don't hother me.

ΤΚ. Stop, while J make an offer toyou.

GR. Faith. Ι only wish you'd offer to be off.

ΤΚ. Do you know anyone here about?

GR. My neighbours, of course.

ΤΚ. ΧΠαΞι-εῑ do you live Ρ

GR. :Xway there ever so far—quite on the edge of the flats· .

Ta. Will γοα let the man who lives in this house settle the
matter?

GR. Let go the rope a bit, while Ι just go off and think it
oven

ΤΚ. (Lets go the rope.) Very well.

GR. (assde.) Bravo! we're all right ! I've bagged this thing
for good. It is my master that our friend here is making our
arbitrator. l’ll be on my own ground here. Never in the
world will he give it against his own man to-day, even for a

sarthing. Sure enough, he has no idea what sort of proposal
he has made. I'm on for the umpire.

TR. Well, then?

GR. I'm quite clear that the wallet is mine by right, but
rather than fight you, I’ll let you have your way.

TR. I like you now. GR. Although the umpire you’re
taking me to is a stranger to me, yet if he acts on the square,
however strange he may be, he’s my friend; if he doesn't‚
friend though he be, I'll have none of him.
