cost you. Off you go, Turbalio, at full spccd, and bring two
clubs here from my house.

TURn. Clubs?

ΒΑΕ. And stout ones at that. Hurry up! I'll sce that
you have the warm reception you deserve.

LA. Alack, alack, what a fool Ι was to lose my head-
piece 011 board ship! lt would come in handy at this mo-
ment, is it were to the fore. Well, 1 may, at least, go up and
speak to them.

ΒΑΕ. No, you may not! (linter Tummmo, hav-ing two clubs.)
Ha, ha! Here comes my dub-man, i' saith, in the very nick
of time.

LA. 1’ saith, my ears begin to tingle 31 that.

ΒΑΕ. Here, Sparax! Take one of those two clubs there!
Here, stand one of you on this side—the other on that! As
you are, now, both of you! Attention! If the rascal
lays a finger upon those girls this day against their will, and
you fail to take your will os him with your clubs, till he ·
doesn’t know his way home—then it's all up with both of
you. If he accosts either of them, do you answer in her
name from where you stand. If, on the other hand, he tries
to make off from here, do you lay about his shins with your
clubs, there and then, with all your might.

LA. What ! are they not to let me budge from here?

ΒΑΕ. Ι have spoken. And when Trachalio gets here with
his master—he has gone to fetch him—then do you both
come indoors without delay. Be very careful about this, if
you please. ’

LA. Odds clubs! How quickly these here temples change
hands. A moment ago our patron saint was the Queen of
HeartS‚—n0w it is the King of Clubs‚ to judge by the two

vclub—armed effigies which this old gentleman has set up. l'
saith, Ι know not where in the world to be off to. Things are
hot for me now, either way—sea and shore alike. Palaestra !

Lo. What 15 it?

LA. You get out! I'm not friends with you ! That's not
my Palaestra who answers. Ho, Ampelisca !

Lo. Just you keep out of mischief!

LA. ’ Pretty good advice from poltroons‚—so far as that’s
possible! But, ho you there !——will there be any harm 'if Ι
go a bit nearer to them?

Lo. None—to us.
