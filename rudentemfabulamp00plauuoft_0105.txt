off. ΒΑΕ. Attention‚ Gripus! Hold your tongue !

GR. What, and let him speak first?

ΒΑΕ. (to Gun’us). Do you listen. (lo TRACHALIO.) Speak

you.
GR. You are going to let another man's slave have the

first word, before your own ? Ru
ΤΚ. There's no stopping h . As 1 was saying, he has
got hold of a wallet belonging to the dealer whom you turned

out of the temple a little while ago.
GR. No, Ι haven't.
ΤΚ. Do you say ‘⁴ no‚'' when Ι 566 it with my own eyes?

GR. (asnia) Plague take your eyes! Suppose I have,
suppose Ι haven't‚ why should you be minding my business?
TR. The question is how you carne by it—rightly or

wroncrlv.
Gr? d If it wasn⁷t a lawful take, I’ll give you leave to hand

to my account of it.

GR. How say you? TR. Till the first speaker has had
his say, shut this fellow up, please‚ if he is your servant.

GR. Ι daresay you want me to get what your master is
always giving you. It may be his way to be always shutting

want now?

TR. well, I don’t ask to go shares in that wallet, and Ι

have never said that it is my property; but it contaIns a
casket belonging to the woman who& Ι have been telling

you is free-born.

ΒΑΕ. You mean the one, don’t you, of whom you were
saying that she was a country-woman of mine?
