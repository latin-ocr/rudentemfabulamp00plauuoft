something or other ; in 511011, 'tu-as for Venus, not for myself,
that l got my houschold gear together, and my well. But

PL. ln the words you uttcr you tell me Ι 3111 1111110116.

ΒΑΕ. So far 35 I 3111 concerncd, all may be well with you.

Sc. No sear of your going home without a meal !

PL. vWhy, so Ι 1101 (lo friends.) Follow me! If only it

One of them is washed out by the wave. But she ’5 111 51131-
low water; now she'll easily get 3511016. Bravo l<lshe is 011
1161 feet and 15 coming our way. All‘s well 1 But the other
1135 leapt 3511016 from the skiff. See how the poor frightened
thing has fallen on her knees in the water! She’s all right ;
she 1135 made her way out and now she’s ashore.v Ah, she 1135
turned to the right and 15 going to perdition. Dear me ! she'll fuffusa}
have a pretty ramble this day. ΒΑΕ. What’s that to you?
