'1'1112 RUDENS OF PLAL‘TUS. 91

ΡΑ. There’s a golden locket, too, which my father gave me
on my birthday.

ΒΑΕ. ’Tis she, without a doubt. Ι cannot keep from clasp-
ing her in my arms Bless you, my daughter! Ι am the
father that reared you. l am Daemones, and see, your
mother, Daedalis, is indoors here.

ΡΑ. Bless you, my father, whom I never hoped to see !
ΒΑΕ. Bless you! and glad 1 am to hold you in my arms.

TR. Ι am delighted that your goodness should have
brought you such good luck.

ΒΑΕ. Ho, Trachalio, see if you can take this wallet and
carry it indoors.

TR. Poor old Gripus! Best congratulationS, Gripus, on
your bad luck !

ΒΑΕ. Come, daughter, let us go to your mother. She will
be the one to sift this business and make it all clear ; she had
more to do with your up-bringing, and she will know your
tokens off by heart.

μμ ὅ Indoors, then, all of us, since we all have a hand in
the affair.

ΡΑ. Follow me, Ampelisca.

AM. I am delighted that heaven sends you such luck.

(Exeunl all, excep! GRIPL'S into collagc, R.)

GR. Am not I an ass for fishing up that wallet this day,
or rather for not hiding it away in some corner after Ι had
fished it up? Faith, Ι thought it would turn out a trouble-
some haul for me, seeing it had turned up in such troublous
weather. Faith, Ι think it must have a lot of gold and silver
inside it. Best for me to go away home and hang mysels on
the quiet—well, at all events, till I can put this chagrin from
me. (Exit GRIPUS into colluge, R) b ⁴
