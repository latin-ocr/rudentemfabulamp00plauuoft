ΒΑΕ. So much the better luck for the inan who lost it ; but
that doesn't make the wallet any more your property.

GR. That’s why you're a poor man—you're too much of a
saint for this world.

ΒΑΕ. Ah, GripuS, Gripus; man's lise is everywhere beset
with snares, wherein he is craftily caught. And in good
sooth most of them are baited with a tempting morsel, and
whoso in his greed greedily snaps at the bait is taken in the
snare for very greed. But whoso warily. cleverly and craftily
takes heed, to him it is given long to enjoy what has been well
earned. That prize of yours, I fancy, will be so made prize
osas to bring a greater blessing in its going than in its com—
ing. (sndzjgrnantgr.) What, arn Ι the man to conceal what Ι
know was another's property before it came to me? Far,
indeed, will that be from the Daemones 1 know, It is the
bounden duty of wise masters ever to be on their guard-
against being privy to the wrong-doing of their people.

GR. Ι have lately heard players utter wise saws of that
sort and get applauded for it, when they preached to the
people their sage maxims. But when they left the place and
went, each to his own home, nobody was what they had told
him to be.

ΒΑΕ. Go indoors and cease·your bother. Restrain your
tongue. I’m not going to give you anything; make no
mistake about that !

GR. I pray heaven that everything in that wallet‚ be it
, gold or silver, will be burned to ashes. (Em'l GRIPUS snlo
foliage, R.)

ΒΑΕ. That explains why slaves are rogues. For if that
slave had happened to come across a dishonest master, he
would have implicated both in theft; while seeking to plunder
others, he would find himself the plundered man—the biter
would be bit. Now, I’ll go away into the house, and then I'll
order our dinner to be cooked at once. (Exit DAEMONES into
coHage, R.)

CANTOR. Now, (geu-en, friends, and give us your applause!
