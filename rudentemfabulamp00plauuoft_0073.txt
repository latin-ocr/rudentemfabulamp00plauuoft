THE RUDENS OF PLAU'H‘S. 51

ΒΑΕ. But 1 am giving you the smooth side of my tongue,
when Ι pray that you may get your deserts.

TR. well, look to this, 1 beg you. ΒΑΕ. what's the matter?

ΤΒ. There are two innocent girls inside here who need
help os you. In defiance os law and justice, they have been
scandalously maltreated in Venus's temple—and it’s still
going on. Besides, the priestess os Venus is being shamesully
handled.

ΒΑΕ. What villain has the effrontery to lay violent hands
on a priestess? These girls, who are they? what wrong is
being done to them?

TR. Listen to me and l'll tell you. They're clinging to
Venus’s statue ; at this very moment the brazen-saced rascal
is bent on tearing them away. By rights they should both
be free.

ΒΑΕ. who is the man that holds the gods so cheap ?—
briefly now.

ΤΚ. A very sink os iniquity and crime, blood-guiltiness
and perjury! A lawless‚ shameless, dirty‚ most obscene ras-
cal—in a word, a trafficker in human beings. What need of
further description Ρ

DAE. That's the description of one who would be the better
for a horse-whipping.

TR. Yes, and the wretch took the priestess by the throat.

ΒΑΕ. By the powers, he will pay dear for that! (goes to the
dooros his cottage.) Come out here, Turbalio, Sparax ! where
are you? TR. Go inside‚ pray, and rescue them.

ΒΑΕ. Must Ι speak twice? this way.

TR. Corne on now; tell them to knock his eyes out just
as cooks do to cuttle—fish. (Exn DAEMoxsss into lenzple‚and
si'az·es (LORAR11)f0llozr· him.)

ΒΑΕ. Pull him out b the feet, just like a stuck pig.

TR.(l1·stem·ng.) Harl< &that noise! They are taking their
fists to the dealer‚ and fancy he is getting a good combing
down. I only hope they have knocked the rascal’s teeth
down his throat. But, see, there are the two girls coming out
of the temple, scared and pale as death.
