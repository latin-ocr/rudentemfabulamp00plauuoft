( 1„ss Anybody who wants to be a poor wretch of a beggar
sffiuld just hand himself over, body and soul, to father
Neptune. XVhen a sellow has anything to do with stim, this
is the sort of quandary in which he lands him at home. But
where is that friend of mine who has been the ruination of
me? See him ! there he comes !

CH. Where the mischief are you hurrying to? why, 1
can’t keep up with you at such a pace.

LA. How I wish that before I ever set eyes upon you, you
had come to a bad end in Sicily, you gallows-bird ! 'Tis all
owing to you that this trouble has fallen on my unhappy
head.

CH. How 1 wish that on the day when you brought me to
your house, Ι had rather made my bed in the common jail !

LA. ’Twas an evil day for me when 1 brought you to my
house. What possessed me ever to listen to you, or to go
away from here, or to go on board ship ?—where Ι have lost
all I ever owned, and more too.

Cu. 'Pon my word, Ι am not a bit surprised at the ship's
’ being wrecked, when it carried a rascal like you and your
rascally gains.

LA. You have done for me with your wheedling talk. It is
all owing to you that I’ve been reduced to such a beggarly
state, listening to your high—sounding mis-statements.

CH. You have every reason to feel obliged to me, for its
owing to me that you have developed such a pretty wit.

LA. You go and be hanged !

Cn. Go yourself! That is just what I was about to say.
