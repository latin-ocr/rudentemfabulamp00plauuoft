Sensi: VII.
(Emer Scnvmmo from temple. c.)

Sc. Mercy o' me! what's ado there? Two girls in this
here ternple tightly clasping Venus's statue! They are in
tears, poor thingS, and there must be somebody or other that
they are afraid of. Last night, they say, they were storin-
tossed ; they were cast ashore this morning—that‘s their story.

LA. Do tell me, Ι beg, young man, where are these wornen
you speak of? Sc. Here in Venus's temple.

LA. How many of them are there?

Sc. As many as you and Ι together.

LA. They’re mine, I'm sure? Sc, I’m sure I can't tell.

LA. What do they look like? Sc. Very nice girls.

LA. They're young girIS, I'm sure P

Se. I’m sure you're a nuisance. Go and look for yourself, ⁴
if you want to.

LA. These girls inside here must be mine, friend Charmides.

CH. Deuce take you in either case, whether they are or
whether they are not.

LA. I'il fling myself at once into the temple. (Eril LAnRAx
into temple.)

CH. Ι had rather you’d fling yourself to perdition. (To SCEP.)
I pray you, sir, give me some corner to sleep in.

Sc. Sleep where you are—anywhere you like—no one will
hinder you : it’s a thoroughfare.

CH. Nay, but you see what wet clothes I've got on. Take
' me indoors and give rne some dry clothes while mine are
drying. Some day I’ll do as much for you,

Sc, See, here's a wrap! ’Tis the only thing Ι have that's
dry. 1’11 give it you, if you like. This serves me for coat—
yes, and for great-coat, too, when it rains. Give me your
toggery ; I’ll have it dried.

CH. 'Sdeath ! Are you not satisfied after Ι have been
cleaned out at sea but that Ι must be cleaned out on shore
again Ρ ’
