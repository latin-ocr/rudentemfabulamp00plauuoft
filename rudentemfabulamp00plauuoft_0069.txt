ladder. Ι made answer to the ape as follows: Sivallows, Ι
said, were the descendants of Philomela, an Athenian. I
charged the ape not to do any harm to my fellow-countrymen.
With this she became much more aggressive. She looked as
if she were actually going to give me fits. She summoned me

villainous beast. Now, as to what this dream may portend,
1 have been unable, so far, to divine. But what racket is this

getting up in Venus's temple hard by? I’m all amaze. M .
