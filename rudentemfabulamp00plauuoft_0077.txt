THE RUDENS OF PLAUTus. 55

refuge at thine altar. We have lost our all in Neptune’s bath

deemest that our garb is somewhat unseemly.

ΤΚ. Venus, methinks their prayer is reasonable. 'Twere
meet for thee to grant their petition; fitly mayst thou pardon
them. Fear forces them to this step. But, see, yonder comes

yours.

SCENE IV.

in tlte custodi* of tlte LORARII.)

ΒΑΕ. Out of the temple there, you most impious of scoun-
drels ever born! (To thegt‘rls.) Do you go and sit down b>-
the altar. But where are they ?

TR. Look here, this way.

ΒΑΕ. Capital! exactly as I wished. Only let him corne

you out1aoe all that is holy ? (To slav s. ) Give him one
between the ey es! (T h ι beat him.)

LA. Y ou shall pay for this affront.

ΒΑΕ. What, does the rascal venture to threaten ?

LA. Ι am robbed of my rights. You are robbing me of
my girls in my own despite.

TR. Name an arbitrator from the senate of Cyrene—-any
responsible man—to decide whether these girls ought to be
your slaves or ought to be free, and whether you OQ not
to be clapped into prison—there to lie until you have worn
out your cell.

LA. I did not come prepared to day to hold converse with
a gallows-bird. (To DAEMONES.) Ι appeal to you, sir.
