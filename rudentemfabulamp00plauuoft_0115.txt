who never expected to have found my child? Surely, when
Heaven is ready to show favour to men, good people some—
how get the good they wish. As forme this day—I never
hoped or looked for this—and yet, unexpectedly, 1 have
found my child. And now I'll give her to a youth of the
best family, a noble Athenian and a kinsman of my own. Ι
should lil<e to have him brought to me here at once, and have
told his servant to start out and go to the sorum. I am
surprised he has not set out by now. I'll to the door, I ¹
think. What is this I see? My wife has clasped our
daughter to her breast, and is holding her there. This
fondling is out of place, and almost more than Ι can stand.
