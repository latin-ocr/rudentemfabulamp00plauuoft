how things have g‹)ne‚—tlie (lealer was off! lle coines to the
harbour, and behold! the ship had got sar out to sea. As for
me, when I saw the girl being carried off, l brought aid to
her, and at the same time destruction to the dealer. I
blew a wintry blast anal tos-scd up the billows of the main.
Arcturus, the most turbulent os all the constellations, ain 1——
tempestuous at my rising, and at iny setting inore tempestu-
⁴ous still. Now, both the dealer ancl liis friend are sitting side
by side upon a rock on which they have been thrown. Their
ship has been dashecl to pleceS. The girl, however, and with
hena young friend„ have jumped from the ship into a boat.
And now the waves are bearing them s‘norewards from the
rock to the old man’s cottage, where he is living in exile 3 its·
tiled roos has been whisked off by the gale. See, there is his
slave, coming out of doorS. The young man will soon be
here—you will see him—the one who bought the girl from
'khe dealer. So Good-bye‚ and God confound your soes !
