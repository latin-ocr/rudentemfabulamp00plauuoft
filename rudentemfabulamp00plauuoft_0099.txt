By whose decision are we to settle the matter?

GR. The wallet's. ΤΚ. Really, you are an ass,

GR. Ι bow to you, Sir Thales.

Ta. That wallet you shan't wall< off with this day, unless
you name a receiver or arbitrator to settle the matter.

GR. Ι say, arel-you in your right mind?

ΤΗ. Ι am mad enough.

GR. And Ι stark mad, but not so mad as to let go this
wallet. Do you want to fight?

ΤΚ. What’s the use. Hadn't we better go halvess

GR. Now I'm Off(g01'ng (fi.)

bring up where you are.

take the helm. Let go the rope, you rascal.

TR. Ι will : you drop the wallet.

GR. Gad-zooks ! you will never be one serap the better for
this to-day.

TR. Say “no'' as often as you like, you can’t get over me—
unless you go shares or refer the matter to an arbitrator or
put the article in the hands osa receiver.

GR. What, when 'twas Ι that fished it up at sea—

TR. But ’twas Ι that watched you from the shore.

GR. With my own toil and trouble, with my own net

κ’ and my own boat?

ffiTR But if the owner were now to come, should Ι be
any the less a thies than you, when I stood by and watched
you keeping his property ? GR. Not a whit ! (slarss qfi'agazbz.)

ΤΚ. stop, you scoundrel ! Just let me hear from you how
you prove that I'm not to share and yet am a thies.

of yourS. All I say is that this is minjs

TR. And I just as much say it's1 me. GR. Stop now, Ι
see how to work it; you needn’t be a thiefor get a share either.
