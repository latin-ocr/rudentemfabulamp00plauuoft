Sc. 1f she falls down the rock to which she is clinging‚
she'll cut short her ramble.

ΒΑΕ. If it is at the expense of those girls that you are
going to dine to-night, Sceparnio, you would do well, Ι think,
to look after them; but if you mean to eat in my house,
then 1 would h'ave you attend to me.

ΡΑ. Man's mr less wretched ·in the telling than the

measure of sorrow that falls to his share in real lise. Can
some deity or other have designed that 1, in such a guise as
this, should be cast upon this unknown shore, a timid girl?
XVas it for this—woe is me !——-that Ι was born? Is this the
reward Ι am to get for my great goodness? It would not be
hard for me to bear this hardship‚ if towards parents or
towards heaven I had ever acted undutifully. But Ι have
been particularly careful to avoid such conduct : surely,
then, all undeserxedly and ungently are ye Gods dealing
with me. What guerdon will the wicked have hereafter, if
innocence is to be rewarded in this way by you Ρ If 1 were
conscious of any sin of mine or of my parents, Ι should be less
sorry for myself. But it is my master's sin that pursues me ;
his wickedness it is that afflicts me. His ship and all he had ‚
he has lost in the sea ; this is the sorry temnant of· his estate.

Ampelisca, too, my c'ompanion in the boat, has been washed
