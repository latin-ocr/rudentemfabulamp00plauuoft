AM. Trachalio, our ship was wreckcd last night.
TR. Ship Ρ What are you talking about?

ᾼΜ. Did you not hear, my dear man, how the dealer was

, going to take us off on the quiet from here to Sicily, and how

he put on board ship all his belongings? They are now at
the bottom os the sea, all of them.

TR. My blessing on you, good Neptune! Faith, you are

¹ the cunningest of dicers! 'Twas a very pretty cast of ,

yours You have wrecked the wretch. But where now is the
dealer Labrax ?

k ² AM. He has drunk himself to death, I fancy. Neptune

treated him to regular bumpers last night.

ΤΚ. Yes, indeed, he did get something to drink—no heel-
taps! How fond I am of you, Ampelisca! How nice you ⁴
are! Your words are like honey! But how did you and
Palaestra get saved?

AM. I'll tell you. We jumped in a fright, both of us, into'
the boat, because we saw that the ship was running on the
rocks I hurried to loose the rope; panic had seized the
crew. The storm drove us in our boat away from them to
the right. And so we were tossed by wind and wave, endur-
ing every form of wretchedness the whole night long. To-
day the wind just managed to carry us ashore‚ more dead

than alive !

. ΤΚ. Yes, yes; that's Neptune's way l He is quite the most

„L “ particular of inspectors. Whenever he finds good-for-nothing

stuff, he pitches it overboard.

AM. Plague take you ἔ J
TR. And you, too, Ampelisca dear! But where is
Palaestra?
AM. Just go into Venus’s temple here and you’ll find her
sitting crying. Ι
TR. I am 'sorry for that. But what are the tears for?
