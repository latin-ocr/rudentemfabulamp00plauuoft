LA. Alaclxnalaclx· Ε Show me a more miserablc wretch than l.
CH. 1 am this much more wretched than you, Labrax—
LA. How?

CH. Because Ι haven‘t deserved it and you have.

LA. Happy‚ happy the lot of those rushes there that ever
keep so jolly dry!

CH. Faith‚ l'm getting into trim for a word-scrimmage ; I'm
trembling so that every syllable l utter has the shivers.

LA. On my conscience, Neptune, you are a chilling bath-
man : when l leave you. even with my clothes on, l
ch-ch-chatter with cold. Not even hot d.inl<s anywhere does
he s-s-s-supply. Such a briny draught he provides, and
with a chill on, too!

CH„ Lucky fellows. blacksmiths, sitting ever beside the firel
They're always warm.

LA. Would that I were a d-d-d-duck, so that when Ι came
out of the water I should be as d-d-d-dry as ever!

CH. What if I were to hire mysels out as a bogey at some
show?

LA. What for?

CH. Because my teeth chatter so loudly. It serves me quite
right. Ι deserve to be cl-cl-cl-cleaned out.

LA. How so?

CH. B-b-b-because Ι was fool enough to go on board with
you. 'Tis you who have turned the sea upside down for me.

LA». Alack! I am reduced to this bit of a shirt and this
· scurvy cloak. I am utterly done for l

CH. I'll go into partnership with you, if you care to; we are
both in the same boat.

LA. [f only the girls were safe, there would be something
to hope for. As things are, if young Plesidippus catches sight
of me—he who gave me part-payment for Palaestra—he'll
lose no time in making things hot for me!

CH. What are you blubbering about, you ass? You will
always have enough, heaven knows, ’to pay your debts in full
with, so long as you have that tongue of yours in your head.
