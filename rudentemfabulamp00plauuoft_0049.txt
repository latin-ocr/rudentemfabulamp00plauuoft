to them. Good-mormw, rissers of the sca—1<nig11ts os the Shell
and Hook—-a starveling tribe ! llow do you do? How dc>
you—don’t?

F. Just like fishermcn, dying os hunger and thirst!

TR. Ι say, have you seen a young follow come here while you
were by ? a brisk-looking, ruddy, stout youth, with a company
os three, dressed in cloaks and carrying ,su-orcis?

F. We don't know os anyone answering to your description
having come here.

TR. Or a bald-headed, snnb-nosed old fellow, well set-up.
pot—bellied—a beetle-browed, scowling rascal, the abomination
of Gods and men—curse him !—a sink of iniquity and vil-
lainy, with two rather pretty girls at his heels?

F. Is these are his qualities and such his record, 'twere fitter ,
for him to make straight for the hangman than for Venus's
temple.

ΤΚ, Do tell me if you have seen him.

F. He has certainly not been here at all, take our word for
it. Good-bye. (Ea-cunt FISHERMEN lo shore, L.)

TR. Good-bye to you! I thought as much. It has hap-
pened just as 1 expected : my master has been taken in, and
that scoundrel of a dealer has fied the country. He's gone
aboard ship and taken the girls with him. O my prophetie
soul ! He invited my master to luncheon here—the fountain
of iniquitv that he is ! Now, what better course for me than

Γ ἒ to waitl‘here until my master comes? In case Ι come across

her, I'll take the opportunity to see whether the priestess of
Venus here knows anything more. She will tell me.

SCENE III.

AM. Ι see; you’d have me knock. at the cottage next to
Venus's temple and ask for water?
TR. Whose voice is wasted to my ear?
